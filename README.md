# Zodiac Signs App : Tomas Uribe Tobon 
The Zodiac Signs App allows the user to input their birthday and the app returns the user's corresponding zodiac sign. Additionally, the user receives a short biography of their zodiac sign. The app is also capable of catching invalid entries in order to provide a more robust experience to the user. This project was completed in Java.
